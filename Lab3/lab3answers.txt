Q1) Camel case is a way to format names of multiple words. Words are joined together
    as one single word, and then each of the words first letter is capitalized.

Q2) Class names are mixed with no spaces and the beginning of each new word will have
    a capital letter. Variable names cannot start with an underscore and are supposed
    to be short, starting with a lowercase letter.

Q3) Standard indentation for curly braces should be that the braces are on their own
    line and whatever is inside the braces should be inserted further in the text.

Q4) Proper indentation is important in Java code because it makes it readable for human
    eyes, and therefore more accessible to see bugs or faulty code that must be fixed.

Q5) The common way to specify a constant value in Java is to set the variable
    equal to whatever value is chosen. Example: int a = 7;

Q6) Unnamed constants in java are usually acceptable as long as they meet the
    required formatting in java.


Q7) a, b, c, d

Q8) a. b%3   = integer
    b. b+4   = integer
    c. b*2.0 = double
    d. c/2   = double
    e. b+c   = double

Q9) A custom class can be more helpful because you can store information to specific
    accounts and it is easier to read for the user.

Q10) A class is more like a template, and an object is more like a specific thing.

Q11) Static methods can use a variable without an object, and it is associated with
     the class directly rather than just an instance of it. Non-static variables
     are declared without using the static keyword, and a separate copy of each
     object variable is created for each instance of a class.

{
  	public static int totalCarsManufactured;
    private double carModel;
}
